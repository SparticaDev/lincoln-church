  <h2 class="welcomeBanner" id="aboutBanner">A History of Lincoln</h2>

  <div class="historyParagraph">
    <p class="historyText">The Lincoln Mill (established 1900) was once the largest cotton mill in Huntsville. The settlement of workers who surrounded this area came to be known as Lincoln Mill Village, a close-knit community of textile workers. Out of this community grew a desire for a congregation of the Lord's church.</p>

    <p class="historyText">The congregation of the Lincoln Church of Christ had its beginning in the year 1937 from the efforts of the Dallas Street congregation, now known as East Huntsville Church of Christ. An annual tent meeting had been held in the Lincoln area for several years. However, in that particular year, a meeting was held with Rufus Underwood who urged the brethren to erect a building on the property that had been previously purchased.</p>

    <p class="historyText">The congregation began with about 70 members and construction commenced on a building estimated to cost approximately $5,000. A significant amount of the construction was done by the members. With the assistance of a contribution from the Lincoln Mill, the building was completed that very year, and the congregation was able to move in debt free.</p>

    <p class="historyText">The area known as Lincoln Mill Village has undergone many changes, ebbing, and flowing through time. It has seen prosperity, despair, and is currently undergoing a new era of resurgence and revitalization. Through the years, the building at Lincoln has also undergone many cosmetic changes, but the mission of our congregation remains unwavering. We are a family of imperfect people striving to serve our perfect Lord, bring lost souls to Christ, and to encourage one another in the grace of our God. The Lincoln Church of Christ looks forward to many years of growth, development, and service to God and to our community.</p>
